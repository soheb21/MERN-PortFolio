Welcome to my portfolio, a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, designed to showcase my skills and projects. The application integrates Redux for efficient state management, ensuring a seamless user experience across different components.

For media and image handling, I’ve implemented Cloudinary, allowing optimized and secure storage and retrieval of visual content. The application also uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication, ensuring data privacy and user verification.

Additionally, I’ve implemented interceptors to streamline request handling, enhancing the app’s performance by managing API calls, token refreshes, and error handling efficiently.
